Running the Code
We created a config.file which specifies the following:
First line mentions the scheduling policy. (0-Random 1-Load Balancing)
Second line mentions the port numbers. (9106-Client-Server, 9107-Server-WorkerNode) which is separated by a single space
From third line on, each line has a description of the hostnames and load value of each WorkerNode, separated by a single space.
(e.g csel-kh4250-06.cselabs.umn.edu 0.2) 
Note: All the values are separated by a single space.


To run the code, we need to follow the following steps:
(Everything needs to be run from the directory in which the files are present)

We first compile the project using the following syntax :
javac -cp ".:/usr/local/Thrift/*" *.java -d .

Then we ssh into the WorkerNodes mention in the config file by ssh-ing into the CSE lab machines. For example, we ssh on 4 machines for running 4 individual worker nodes. 

We then run the WorkerNodes individually using the following command
java -cp ".:/usr/local/Thrift/*" WorkerNode

We then run the Server on the local node using:
java -cp ".:/usr/local/Thrift/*" Server

Next, we then run the Client on the local node to run the entire Map-Reduce functionality:
java -cp ".:/usr/local/Thrift/*" Client
